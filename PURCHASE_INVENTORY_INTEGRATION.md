# Purchase Inventory Integration

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of automatic inventory management when creating new purchases. When a purchase is created, the system now automatically updates inventory levels by adding the purchased quantities to the corresponding inventory items.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (Laravel)

#### 1. Modified PurchaseController (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/PurchaseController.php`)

**Added Dependencies:**
- `App\Services\InventoryService` - For handling inventory transactions
- `App\Models\InventoryItem` - For managing inventory items

**Updated Constructor:**
```php
public function __construct(InventoryService $inventoryService)
{
    $this->inventoryService = $inventoryService;
    // ... existing middleware
}
```

**Added Helper Method:**
```php
private function findOrCreateInventoryItem($productTypeId, $supplierId = null)
```
This method:
- Searches for existing active inventory item for the product type
- Creates a new inventory item if none exists
- Links the inventory item to the supplier if provided

**Updated Store Method:**
The `store()` method now includes inventory management:
- After creating the purchase and its items
- Iterates through each purchased item
- Finds or creates corresponding inventory items
- Uses `InventoryService::addStock()` to:
  - Create an inventory transaction record
  - Update the current stock level
  - Record the unit cost
  - Link the transaction to the purchase

**Error Handling:**
- Inventory updates are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Purchase creation continues even if some inventory updates fail
- Warnings are logged and returned in the response
- All operations are wrapped in a database transaction

### Frontend Changes (React/TypeScript)

#### 1. Fixed TypeScript Types (`src/pages/purchases/NewPurchasePage.tsx`)

**Type Safety Improvements:**
- Added proper typing for form schema
- Created `PurchaseFormSchemaType` from Zod schema
- Fixed linter errors related to `any` types
- Properly typed the `onSubmit` function

## How It Works

### Purchase Creation Flow

1. **User Creates Purchase:**
   - Selects supplier, items, quantities, and unit prices
   - Submits the purchase form

2. **Backend Processing:**
   - Validates purchase data
   - Creates purchase record
   - Creates purchase items
   - **NEW:** For each purchased item:
     - Finds existing inventory item by `product_type_id`
     - If no inventory item exists, creates one automatically
     - Creates inventory transaction of type "purchase"
     - Updates inventory item's current stock
     - Records unit cost and total cost

3. **Inventory Transaction Details:**
   - **Transaction Type:** "purchase"
   - **Reference Type:** "purchase"
   - **Reference ID:** Purchase ID
   - **Quantity:** Added to stock (positive value)
   - **Unit Cost:** From purchase item
   - **Notes:** Descriptive text with purchase reference

### Auto-Creation of Inventory Items

When a purchase includes a product type that doesn't have an inventory item:

```php
InventoryItem::create([
    'product_type_id' => $productTypeId,
    'sku' => 'AUTO-' . $productTypeId . '-' . time(),
    'description' => 'Auto-created from purchase',
    'unit' => 'pcs', // Default unit
    'min_stock_level' => 0,
    'max_stock_level' => 1000,
    'current_stock' => 0,
    'cost_per_unit' => 0,
    'supplier_id' => $supplierId,
    'is_active' => true
]);
```

## Database Schema

### Inventory Transactions Table
- `inventory_item_id` - Links to inventory item
- `transaction_type` - "purchase" for purchase transactions
- `quantity` - Amount added (positive for purchases)
- `unit_cost` - Cost per unit from purchase
- `total_cost` - quantity Ã— unit_cost
- `reference_type` - "purchase"
- `reference_id` - Purchase ID
- `notes` - Descriptive text
- `user_id` - User who created the purchase

### Inventory Items Table
- `product_type_id` - Links to product types
- `current_stock` - Updated when purchases are made
- `cost_per_unit` - Updated with latest purchase cost
- `supplier_id` - Set to purchase supplier for auto-created items

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. **Create a Purchase:**
   - Navigate to "New Purchase" page
   - Select supplier and add items with quantities and prices
   - Submit the purchase

2. **Verify Inventory Updates:**
   - Check inventory items list
   - Verify stock levels increased by purchased quantities
   - Check inventory transactions for purchase records

3. **Check Auto-Creation:**
   - Purchase items for product types without existing inventory items
   - Verify new inventory items are created automatically

## Error Handling

- **Inventory Service Errors:** Logged and returned as warnings
- **Missing Product Types:** Handled gracefully with warnings
- **Database Failures:** Full transaction rollback
- **Partial Failures:** Purchase succeeds, inventory warnings reported

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Inventory Management:** No manual stock entry required
2. **Audit Trail:** Complete transaction history
3. **Cost Tracking:** Unit costs automatically recorded
4. **Supplier Linking:** Inventory items linked to suppliers
5. **Error Resilience:** Purchase succeeds even with inventory issues
6. **Seamless Integration:** No UI changes required for basic functionality

## Future Enhancements

- Unit conversion support
- Batch/lot tracking
- Expiration date management
- Inventory alerts and notifications
- Advanced cost averaging methods
